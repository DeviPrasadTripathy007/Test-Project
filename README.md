# Test-Project
Just a Blank project to test the git and git-hub commands
<br><br>
# Why we use git-hub?
-Version Control <br>
-History of changes are stored so that we can revert back if something went wrong or something taking more time to implrement and we want to continue it in the future or remove the feature entirely<br>
-Collaboration
